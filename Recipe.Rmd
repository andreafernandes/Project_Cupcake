## Recipe for the best cupcake in the world


110g/4oz butter or margarine, softened at room temperature

110g/4oz caster sugar



2 free-range eggs, lightly beaten

1 tsp vanilla extract
110g/4oz self-raising flour
1-2 tbsp milk
For the buttercream icing
140g/5oz butter, softened
280g/10oz icing sugar
1-2 tbsp milk
a few drops food colouring

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
